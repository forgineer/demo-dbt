# dbt DuckDB Demo

## Purpose

This repository is a well-documented, minimal outline for using **dbt-core** as a data transformation tool.  
It is designed for data engineers who want a clear, step-by-step guide to dbt-core, without the complexity or ambiguity often found in official documentation.

## Why This Repo?

- The official dbt documentation can be difficult to follow, even for experienced engineers.
- This guide aims to be concise, practical, and easy to use.
- No sign-ups, cloud accounts, or risk of incurring chargesâ€”**DuckDB** is used as the data warehouse for its simplicity and local operation.
